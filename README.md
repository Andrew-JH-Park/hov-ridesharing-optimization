# HOV Ridesharing Optimization Module

This project implements a real-time optimization algorithm for assigning vehicles to ride requests in a shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) setting. It builds on dynamic trip-vehicle assignment principles introduced by Alonso-Mora et al. and formulates the matching process as an ILP-based optimization problem. This module is designed to be embedded in larger simulation environments or used for offline evaluation of algorithm performance.

## üìñ Problem Overview

At each decision epoch, the system aims to:

1. Construct feasible **trip-vehicle** combinations respecting:
   - Pickup time windows (Œ©)
   - Maximum travel delay (Œî)
   - Vehicle capacity
2. Build the **RTV graph** where:
   - Nodes = trips, vehicles
   - Edges = feasible assignments
3. Solve an **integer linear program (ILP)** to minimize:
   - Total passenger delay
   - Penalty for unserved requests
